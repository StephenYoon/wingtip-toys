# WingTip Toys Product Catalog

Sample Angular .NET Core Web Application created with Visual Studio Community 2019, Version 16.5.4

Motivation for using Angular with .NET Core API backend comes from the quick scaffolding of a web application with many benefits (in my humble opinion). 
  
Angular, an opensource JavaScript framework designed for building scalable and dynamic web applications. Angular uses pure HTML as its template language, but allows us to extend HTMLâ€™s syntax and combine it with functionality in order to build higher-level components. The TypeScript language, support for dependency injection, lazy loading modules, two-way data binding and organizing your application with components are some of the benefits developers can take advantage of.
  
## Prerequisites:
